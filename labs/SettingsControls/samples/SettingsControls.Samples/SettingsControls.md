SettingsCard is a control that can be used to display settings in your experience. It uses the default styling found in Windows 11 and is easy to use, meets all accesibility standards and will make your settings page look great!
You can set the Header, Description, Icon and Content.

By setting the IsClickEnabled property you can turn the SettingsCard into a button-like experience.
This can be useful whenever you want your settings component to e.g. navigate to a detail page or open an external link.
