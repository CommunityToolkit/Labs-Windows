# RivePlayer

This is a high level control for playing a [Rive state machine](https://rive.app/features#state-machine) or animation. A state machine's specific [inputs](https://help.rive.app/editor/state-machine#inputs) can be declared in XAML as nested properties, and controlled interactively via code or data binding.
