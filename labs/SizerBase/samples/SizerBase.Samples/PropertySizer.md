# PropertySizer

The PropertySizer is a control which can be used to manipulate the value of another <c>double</c> based property. For instance manipulating the <c>OpenPaneLength</c> of a <c>NavigationView</c> control. If you are using a <see cref="Grid"/>, use <see cref="GridSplitter"/> instead.

# Examples 

The main use-case is for PropertySizer to allow you to manipulate the `OpenPaneLength` property of a `NavigationView` control to create a user customizable size shelf. This is handy when using NavigationView with a tree of items that represents some project or folder structure for your application.

Both GridSplitter and ContentSizer are insufficient as they would force the NavigationView to a specific size and not allow it to remember its size when it expands or collapses.
