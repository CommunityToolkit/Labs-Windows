    HOW TO USE THIS FILE

    WinUI 2 under UWP uses TargetFramework uap10.0.*
    WinUI 3 under WinAppSdk uses TargetFramework net6.0-windows10.*
    However, under Uno-powered platforms, both WinUI 2 and 3 share the same TargetFramework.
    
    MSBuild doesn't play nicely with this out of the box, so we've made it easy for you.

    For .NET Standard packages, you can use the Nuget Package Manager in Visual Studio.
    For WinUI 2 / Uno packages, place the package references here.
