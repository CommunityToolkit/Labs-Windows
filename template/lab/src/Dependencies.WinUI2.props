    HOW TO USE THIS FILE

    WinUI 2 under UWP uses TargetFramework uap10.0.*
    WinUI 3 under WinAppSdk uses TargetFramework net6.0-windows10.*
    However, under Uno-powered platforms, both WinUI 2 and 3 share the same TargetFramework.
    
    MSBuild doesn't play nicely with this out of the box, so we've made it easy for you.  
    Place nuget packages designed to work under WinUI 2 / Uno here.
