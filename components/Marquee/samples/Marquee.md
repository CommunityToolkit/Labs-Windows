The Marquee control allows text or other content to scroll in a marquee fashion. The control is heavily templated and many changes can be made by modifying the style. The control can also be adjusted using the Speed, Behavior, RepeatBehavior, and Direction properties.

## Speed

The speed property determines how quickly the content moves in pixels per second. The speed can be adjusted mid-animation and handled continously.

## Behavior

The Marquee control has 3 behaviors

### Ticker

Ticker mode starts with all content off the screen then scrolls the content across across the screen. When the animation finishes in the mode no content will be on screen.

### Looping

Looping mode will begin with the start of the content fully in frame then scroll towards the end. When the end is reached it will loop back to the start of the content. Nothing will happen if the content fits in frame.

### Bouncing

Looping mode will begin with the start of the content fully in frame then scroll towards the end. When the end is reached it will bounce and scroll backwards to the start of the content. Nothing will happen if the content fits in frame.

## RepeatBehavior

The repeat behavior determines how many times the marquee will loop before the animation finishes. It can be a number of iteration, a duration, or forever.

## Direction

The default direction is left, meaning the content will move leftwards, but this can be changed to right, up, or down. Direction changed between left and right or up and down are handled continously, meaning that the animation will resume from its current position if changed between these directions.

## Non-Text Content

It is possible to use non-text content in the Marquee control. However templating must be used because the control will need to be duplicated for the looping animation.
