# MarkdownTextBlock

MarkdownTextBlock is a evolution of the existing MarkdownTextBlock in the community toolkit. This new implementation uses the popular [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) library for parsing. This solves some long standing bugs and feature gaps in our existing implementation.

## Feature Showcase
