# MarkdownTextBlock

MarkdownTextBlock is a evolution of the existing MarkdownTextBlock in the community toolkit. This new implementation uses the popular [Markdig](https://github.com/xoofx/markdig) library for parsing. This solves some long standing bugs and feature gaps in our existing implementation.

## Templated Controls

The Toolkit is built with templated controls. This provides developers a flexible way to restyle components
easily while still inheriting the general functionality a control provides. The examples below show
how a component can use a default style and then get overridden by the end developer.
